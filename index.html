                            This website was originally built in 2022 for a competition, and I am working to revamp it for this class.
                            In fact, if you were to take a look at the files, you would find a lot of clutter and badly written code from my 2022 self.
                            As of right now, it is quite barebones and not very neat, but hopefully it will become much prettier in the near future.

                    This is "La Vaguelette" performed by CÃ©cilia Cara and produced by Hoyo-Mix for the game Genshin Impact. Click <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/lm3t3myPspk?si=5MUL-DXXfKFz_B-2" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> for the non-video version.
                    I don't know any French, but I still love this song. The character Furina sings this song at the climax of their character arc.
                    Furina is the mortal half of a god who split themselves in half and sacrificed their divine half to save their people.
                    This had to be done in order to deceive the higher gods who had condemned her people to death. Part of this plan was having her
                    mortal half pretend to still have her powers which had been given to the divine half. This facade had to be performed for 500 years.
                    Furina was an actor, but in reality, she was always acting--pretending to be a powerful god whilst possessing no powers. After this
                    ends, she refuses to act again; she can't handle doing it anymore. However, this song is performed during a play in which Furina
                    takes over the actor's role to keep the play moving forward. The play and the song's lyrics mirror the events of the main story and her
                    own personal tale within its context. Through this final performance, she is able to enjoy acting again and the conclusion of her character
                    arc is signified by her receiving a vision which allows their owners to wield elemental powers and is only granted to people whose ambitions
                    have climaxed. This song reminds me of this part of the story and Furina's incredibly moving character arc which is why I love this song.
                    Throughout this list you'll see that I like a lot of songs that are attached to stories I am deeply connected with or evoke certain emotions within me.
                    Aside from the context and feeling of the song, I also like its style. The entire region shares this style.

                    This is "Weight of the World" from the game NieR: Automata. This song is performed in three different versions. 
                    <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/ToBQY630PZE?si=7zitc_qKqpnCyarx" target="_blank"><u>English by J'Nique Nicole</u></a>,

                    <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/tiulg9ySfR8?si=Payz2NBANaFZ4G362" target="_blank"><u>and in an original language created for the game, 'Chaos' by Emi Evans</u></a>.
                    The version in the video to the left is a medley of the three languages as well as a choral accompaniment. Each of this song's versions
                    plays at a different ending of the game.
                    Nier; Automata has a total of 5 (4, as 2 endings occur almost simultaneously) main 'endings,' although in reality they occur in sequence and act more as chapters in the story
                    rather than separate endings. The game is a sequel to the original Nier, now remastered as Nier; RepliCant.
                    The game's story revolves around themes of what it means to be human and the meaning of life. The main characters struggle to search
                    for answers to these questions as they fight an endless war whose belligerents have long since perished. This story greatly resonated with me
                    and played a large role in the development of my aspiration to be a writer. I still get goosebumps every time I hear this song in any of its versions.
                    The song's lyrics encapsulate the question asked by the game to the player. I considered putting a video of the final ending here,
                    but I decided against it should you choose to experience the game yourself. I highly recommend it. Beyond the context of this song,
                    The 'Chaos' language used in one version of this song was created as an in-universe language. The game happens so far in the future that it
                    is theorized by then all language might have melded into one language that every person speaks. 'Chaos' is exactly that. It draws on sounds
                    used in a variety of languages to create a language that sounds like a melting pot of every existing culture.

                    This is "Stereo Hearts" by Gym Class Heroes featuring Adam Levine. I love this song. The reason why? Well, some say, my heart is like a stereo.
                    It beats for you, so listen close, and you can hear my thoughts in every note. If you make me your radio, and turn me up when you feel low, this melody was made for you, so you can sing along to my stereo. 
                    <!-- (Gym class heroes) If I was just another dusty record on the shelf, would you blow me off and play me like everybody else? And if I asked you to scratch my back could you manage that? Like yikky-yeah Travie I can handle that. Furthermore I apologize for any skipping tracks. It's just the last girl who played me left a couple cracks. I used to used to used to now I'm over that, cuz' holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts. And if I could only find a note to make you understand, I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand. Just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune, and know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you. my heart's a stereo it beats for you so listen close hear my thoughts in ever no-o-ote make me your radio and turn me up when you feel low this melody was made for you so sing along to my stereo o o o o o o o to my stereo o o o o so sing along to my stereo let's go if i was an old school fifty pound boombox would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walked would you turn my volume up in front of the cops and crank it higher every time they told you to stop and alll i asl is that you don't get mad at me cuz when you have to purchase mad d batteries appreciate every mixtape your friends make you never know we come and go like onf the interstate i think i finally found a note to make you understand if you can hit it sing along and grab me by the hand just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune, you know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you my heart's a stereo it beats for you so listen close hear my thoughts in every no o ote make me your radio and turn me up when you feel low this melody was meant for you so sing along to my stereo o o o o o o o o o o o o so sing along to my stereo i only pray you'll never leave me behind never leave me because good music can be so hard to find so hard to find i take your hand and hold it closer to mine thought love was dead but now you're changing my mind ah ah ah my heart's a stereo it beats for you so listen close hear my thoughts in ever no o ote make me your radio and turn me up when you feel low this melody was made for you so sing along to my stereo o o o o o o o o o o o o so sing along to my stereo yeah -->
                    I was originally just going to write out the lyrics from memory (and I did, you can find it in the code) but I decided to add some
                    substance to this one instead. I really like the entire era of 2000s-2010s pop music. I can't exactly say why I like it so much.
                    It's probably nostalgia, but I've listened to some songs from that era which I've never heard before that I also love. I think it's
                    just the style of that time that draws me in. They hype me up so much more than a lot of other music I've listened to and I love hearing them
                    at parties and jamming out to them with my friends. I love the songs from Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, One Direction, and so many more artists
                    from that time, but I don't listen to any of their new music, if they have any (RIP One Direction, I missed my chance to see them live :( how do I recover from this)

                    This is âReason for Existenceâ by Tsukuyomi. <br><a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/86IxCGKUOzY?si=ywe5SYBTB-g2upvt" target="_blank"><u>Here</u></a>
                     is the non-video version. I don't know any Japanese, but I still end up listening to a lot of Jpop 
                    because of anime and such, but I still listen to some Jpop outside of anime. Tsukuyomi is one of those artists I listen 
                    to without any connection to anime I watch. I just really like the vibe of their music, their voice, and their style. 
                    For most other music I like, a large part of it is the context, but I don't have that for Tsukuyomiâs music. Still, I like
                    it. I don't have as much to say about them because there's no context to cover or really any deep story, but I guess I also
                    appreciate how their albums, despite being few in number, do somewhat sound connected. The tones are similar throughout and
                    each song almost feels like a logical continuation. Maybe that's just for me, though. While finishing this project, I realized
                    another thing; I really like the video accompaniments for these songs. I like the art styles and the stories they tell.

                    This is "Anytime Anywhere" by milet and Evan Call, produced for the anime "Frieren: Beyond Journey's End."
                    <br><a class="link" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=OqQAFmkrzew&si=KtIdeNrZ-yqIiKR5" target="_blank"><u>This</u></a>
                    is the non-video version.
                    Evan Call is a prolific composer for many anime soundtracks. I particularly enjoy his work on "Violet Evergarden."
                    milet is the vocalist for most of the tracks used in this anime and Evan Call produced all of the music.
                    His style is very distinct and never fails to evoke emotion during the climax of a scene. This song specifically was the
                    main ending theme for the entire show. The first half featured the first half of the song as the ending theme while
                    the second half of the show used the second half of the song as its ending theme. This was an amazing decision as the first half of the song 
                    is more unsure and asks questions while the second half is much more confident and receives responses during the verse.
                    This reflects the growth of the main character throughout the show and adds a wonderful little detail to something so generally
                    overlooked as the ending theme. The music used for this show
                    really elevates its quality. I will never forget the two episodes when "bliss" plays, Fern's fight with "Zoltraak" in the background,
                    or Stark's assault on the dragon with "Dragon Smasher" playing. The music really amplifies the scenes and ties in both quality
                    and context, creating music I truly enjoy.
