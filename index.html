                            Welcome to Arav Kodali's Creative Writing: Intro to Multimedia Composition Portfolio.
                            This website was originally built in 2022 for a competition, and I am working to revamp it for this class.
                            In fact, if you were to take a look at the files, you would find a lot of clutter and badly written code from my 2022 self.
                            As of right now, it is quite barebones and not very neat, but hopefully it will become much prettier in the near future.

                    I don't know any French, but I still love this song. The character Furina sings this song at the climax of their character arc.
                    Furina is the mortal half of a god who split themselves in half and sacrificed their divine half to save their people.
                    This had to be done in order to deceive the higher gods who had condemned her people to death. Part of this plan was having her
                    mortal half pretend to still have her powers which had been given to the divine half. This facade had to be performed for 500 years.
                    Furina was an actor, but in reality, she was always acting--pretending to be a powerful god whilst possessing no powers. After this
                    ends, she refuses to act again; she can't handle doing it anymore. However, this song is performed during a play in which Furina
                    takes over the actor's role to keep the play moving forward. The play and the song's lyrics mirror the events of the main story and her
                    own personal tale within its context. Through this final performance, she is able to enjoy acting again and the conclusion of her character
                    arc is signified by her receiving a vision which allows their owners to wield elemental powers and is only granted to people whose ambitions
                    have climaxed. This song reminds me of this part of the story and Furina's incredibly moving character arc which is why I love this song.
                    Throughout this list you'll see that I like a lot of songs that are attached to stories I am deeply connected with or evoke certain emotions within me.
                    Aside from the context and feeling of the song, I also like its style. The entire region shares this style.
